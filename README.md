This is one of my little projects dedicated to practicing with a programming language.

This particular project is dedicated to figure and try out ways to compare complex data structures in Go (such as structs with some fields being slices of other structs and so on), making sure that the order of slices's items don't mistakenly interfere with the comparison result.

Although this is only a little study/practice project, feel free to clone it and use as a starting point to your own studies or to share any ideas -- that will be much appreciated!

Happy coding!
